# Character Creator by Alex Meyers
 
Motivation: 
I enjoy running tabletop games of Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition for a group of younger players at a local game store. I realized that there was a need for a simple, easy to use character creation tool for my players. Current online tools are either paid subscription services, or provide an overwhelming amount of customization and content, that can be overwhelming for the first time player. 
I am developing this tool to allow first time players to create a fully functioning character sheet for their first Dungeons & Dragons game, with a focus on ease of access.
